    <h1>Darius Rucker - For The First Time</h1>

    <p>
        You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars <br>
            Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark <br>
            You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same <br>
            Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change <br>
            When was the last time you did something for the first time? <br>
            Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling <br>
            Maybe something new is what you're needing <br>
            Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive <br>
            When was the last time you did something for the first time? <br>
            Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud <br>
            Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up <br>
            Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove <br>
            But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you <br>
            When was the last time you did something for the first time? <br>
            Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling <br>
            Maybe something new is what you're needing <br>
            Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive <br>
            When was the last time you did something for the first time? <br>
            Now the way you're looking says you're living <br>]
            I hope I ain't reading wrong <br>
            'Cause the way you're shining, I think you're thinking  <br>
            It's been way too long <br>
            When was the last time you did something for the first time? <br>
            Yeah yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling <br>
            Maybe something new is what you're needing <br>
            Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive <br>
            When was the last time oh you did something for the first time, girl? <br>
            Come on, baby <br>
    </p>
